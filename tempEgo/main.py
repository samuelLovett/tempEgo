Description:
Estimate the 2D body-frame velocity vector of the sensor platform given input data from a single radar as described in
[1]. For use with your own radar sensor modify the code in the update_buffer_weighted method.

The velocity estimation scheme takes the following approach:

1. A weighting is applied to all datapoints within the sliding window based on the datapoints corresponding
measurement-index

2. A RANSAC outlier rejection method is used to filter the data which contains a large amount of
outliers. RANSAC selects points uniformly or based on their weights to estimate the velocity. This process is then
repeated until a first-pass velocity estimate is derived from the best inlier set.

3. Least Squares Distance Regression (LSQ) is initialized with the inlier set and used to calculate the final velocity
estimate of the body frame linear velocity.
